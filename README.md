> *"How many coffee shops in Boston?"*

Hmmm...well, suppose there are 1 million people in Boston. Then... NOPE. Stop it. This series is nothing about strategy for any brain teaser.
This is an analysis about two major coffeehouse chains, Starbucks vs Dunkin' Donuts, "corporate + license" vs pure franchise, in Boston area. I will walk you through their distribution and strategies of choosing a location (if consistent). This series is roughly separated by following parts.
   
* Part 0: Get the data prepared!
* Part 1: A glance at locations
* Part 2: What can we expect around a store? - Bayesian Analysis
* Part 3: What can we expect around a store? - Network Visualization
